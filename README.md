# Memory-Game

You should be able to run this code by any c++ plateform. 
Input the size of the game that you want to play (The game becomes a little hard when it's bigger than 4x4). After that you can start choosing cards to reveal, two at a time, and when you choose two numbers that have the same number the game will tag them as "revealed". Once you open all the cards you finish the game and it tells you how many turns it took you to win.

I used two-dimension char arrays to help format the output.
In the beginning, the game was giving the same cards every time. This is because the numbers generated by the function rand() are actually pseudo random numbers. I used the time (the function time()) to give more random sets of cards.
