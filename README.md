# Memory-Game

You should be able to run this code by any c++ plateform. 
Input the size of the game that you want to play (The game becomes a little hard when it's bigger than 4x4). After that you can start choosing cards to reveal, two at a time, and when you choose two numbers that have the same number the game will tag them as "revealed". Once you open all the cards you finish the game and it tells you how many turns it took you to win.
